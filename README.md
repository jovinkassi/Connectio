## How we built it
Connectio was developed with a strong emphasis on user experience and accessibility. To achieve this, we utilized a combination of modern web development technologies. Our frontend was built using React, ensuring a responsive and interactive interface for users. On the backend, we leveraged Flask to handle server-side logic and API interactions. Additionally, we integrated Gemini APIs for secure transactions and Chainlit for managing our comprehensive database of goods and services. This tech stack enabled us to create an intuitive platform with seamless navigation and efficient search functionality, empowering users to easily find the resources they need for their entrepreneurial endeavors.
